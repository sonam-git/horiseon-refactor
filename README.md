# Horiseon-Refactor
The main purpose of this week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility..

# Description
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities 
can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making 
a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned
in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access
their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of 
specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it 
(recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards 
or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to 
make it more accessible.
# User Story
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
# Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
# Motivation
This motivates you to work on different semantic HTML element and css to work on the accessibility of your website, 
which is one of the most essential aspect that any webpage should have nowadays.

# Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS

# Build Status
We were already given a starter code for this challenge, and we mostly need to substitute the div into semantic HTML elements for accessibility, and avoid WET coding.

# code Style
Since weâ€™re already given a starter code for this project.We basically replace multiple div elements to the semantic HTML elements avoiding WET coding to give better 
accessibility and functionality.

## HTML
* Replace div elements into semantic HTML as needed to meet accessibility standard.
* Link some of the broken link to the corresponding page
* avoid WET coding
* Comment every line of code within html and css page 
## CSS
* comment on every line of code for different css selectors
* Reduce the line of code to avoid WET coding
* Use of CSS class and CSS id selector
